Statue Scramble 02  

Following on from the initial 1st iteration of the Unreal Engine 5.2 3rd person game, have undertaken to implement simple animations to the game using Blueprints.  

Requiremnents: Animation  
Dive deeper into the world of character movement and animation. Implement unique animations using the animation blueprint. You will be assessed on the fluidity, creativity, and technical implementation of your animations.  
  
G (Pass): Create an animation sequence for a character or object using Unreal's Animation Blueprint. Your animation should transition smoothly between states in the State Machine, and use Blend Spaces for blending animations based on variables.  
  
VG (Distinction): Your animation should demonstrate interaction with the environment or another character, e.g. by using Animation Montages.  

Let's Go (again) !

Using pre-rigged character and animations downloaded from Mixamo, replaced the Unreal Manniquin with new mesh. Then created Animation Blueprint to enable character to switch between animations.

Made use of BlendSpace to enable smoother transition between Idle <-> Walk <-> Run.

Also created a short clip of a blend of anaimations using Anim Montage set to play at Game Over

Plus: Did add simple sfx on statue collected and background music.
